# DXARTS-472

This is a project for Mechatronic Art, Design and Faberication II.

The project uses OpenCV, Arduino, and Processing.

The project is about utilizing cameras as an external eye to play on the idea of Posthumanism and being anti-social. When the camera recognizes a face, it will look away immediately, playing on the idea of avoiding conversation with others.
